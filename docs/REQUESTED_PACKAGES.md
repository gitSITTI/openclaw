# Requested Packages

This notes requested packages that were asked about during review and are not currently present in `package.json`.

- `grepilte` / `grepilte` (uncertain spelling) — not present in dependencies.
- `coderabbit` — not present in dependencies.

Before adding either package:

- Confirm exact package names and preferred placement (`dependencies` vs `devDependencies`).
- Check license compatibility and any required peer deps.
- Add a minimal integration test or example usage to verify the package works as intended.
